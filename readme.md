[u/sussy-bot-2](https://reddit.com/u/sussy-bot-2) is a reddit bot which replies to the comments where it is mentioned in with a [sus copypasta](https://pastebin.com/raw/RGJupQDa). I host the main file using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and I try to keep the reply bot running as a background task on my phone using [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app)

Join the official subreddit [r/sussybot](https://reddit.com/r/sussybot) and keep being sus!
